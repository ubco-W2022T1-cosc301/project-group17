# Group 017 - Worker Productivity

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We are going to be investigating how factors such as population, hours worked, and allotted vacation time contribute to the measured productivity which is the output of goods or services provided, divided by the input, which is the amount of work hours required to produce those goods. We will use the out-side real GDP, total hours worked, and population, to create this metric to quantify the productivity of a country. We are interested in the project because it allowed us to pick countries to analzye that are similar in economic structure and prosperity to Canada. This is in order to understand how the implementation of our variables could contribute to a more productive Canada. Our dataset could certainly be imported into an interactive dashboard.

**Please remember to update this section**

The main dataset is provided by the Groningen Growth and Development Centre, from the University of Groningen. This dataset, the Penn World Table (PWT), provides data on income, productivty, wages, hours worked, GDP, relative output and more. We suppliment this data with information on vacation days, and GPD produced per hour worked. The most recent update of the data set was on June 18, 2021. The Penn World Table was first published in 1988, however the "next generation" PWT was created in 2015.  The reason this dataset was created was to investigate the real GDP across different benchmarks with applications in development accounting in mind. We supplement this dataset with data from the OECD on GDP produce per hour worked, and Huberman & Minns (2007) for information on allotted vacation days for workers.
